A Space For Everyone
SacHacks is the first major intercollegiate hackathon in the Sacramento, California area.
We provide the place, you bring your ideas to our friendly competition where all creative coders launch their ideas into action during a 24-hour hackathon.

But if you’re near Davis, you’re in luck—we’re offering in-person workspaces for our participants, giving you a dedicated space to collaborate and hack alongside others. Plus, enjoy live-streamed workshops and virtual submissions to make the most of your experience!
FAQ
What is a hackathon?
-
A hackathon is a high-energy event where innovators, coders, and creatives unite to bring ideas to life in a short span of time. At SacHacks, we believe that coding, design, and entrepreneurship are equally important—our motto is Design, Code, and Launch. We don’t just focus on building great products; we emphasize how they are designed, developed, and launched into the world to make a real impact. Whether you're here to create, collaborate, or turn your vision into the next big venture, SacHacks is the place to be!
When & Where?
-
SacHacks will take place on March 1st & 2nd as a 24-hour virtual hackathon! Submissions and workshops will be hosted online, making it accessible to participants worldwide. For UC Davis students and those near Davis, we’ll provide in-person workspaces to collaborate, brainstorm, and build together. Whether you’re coding remotely or on-site, our technical mentors will be available both online and in person to help tackle any challenges. Stay tuned for more updates—big things are coming!
Who can attend?
-
Anyone 18 or older can participate—whether you're a high school senior, recent grad, undergrad, or master's student. No experience needed—just bring your creativity and passion!
Does it cost anything?
-
